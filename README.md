Source code for our paper "Fast Graph Sampling Set Selection Using Gershgorin Disc Alignment". Very fast deterministic graph sampling algorithm without eigen-decomposition.

## Prerequisite

Matlab(>=R2015a)

## How to run the code

```
Step 1. run setup.m to compile .cpp files
Step 2. run pathgraph_test.m, a path graph sampling example
```

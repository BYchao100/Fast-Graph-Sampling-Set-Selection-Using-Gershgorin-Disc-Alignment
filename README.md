# Fast Graph Sampling Using Gershgorin Disc Alignment

Source code of our paper "Fast Graph Sampling Set Selection Using Gershgorin Disc Alignment".
Very fast deterministic graph sampling algorithm without explicit eigen-decomposition.

## Prerequisite

Matlab(>=R2015a)

## How to run the code

```
Step 1. run setup.m to compile .cpp files
Step 2. run pathgraph_test.m as a path graph sampling example
```
